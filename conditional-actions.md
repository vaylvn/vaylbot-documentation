# Conditional Actions

Conditional actions in **Vayl** allow you to create logic-based behavior for your chatbot. These actions evaluate Python-style expressions, executing specific actions based on whether the condition evaluates to `true` or `false`.

---

## How Conditionals Work

Each conditional has three key components:
1. **Condition**: A Python expression that determines the logical outcome (`true` or `false`).
2. **True Actions**: A list of actions executed if the condition evaluates to `true`.
3. **False Actions**: A list of actions executed if the condition evaluates to `false`.

### Syntax
If working on an individual conditional `(conditionals/conditional_name.yml)`:
```yaml
condition: "<if-statement expression>"
true:
- <action_1> ; <arguments>
- <action_2> ; <arguments>
false:
- <action_3> ; <arguments>
```
If working on a nested conditional `("conditional_name" within conditionals/conditional_name.yml)`:
```yaml
conditionals:
    conditional_name:
        condition: "<if-statement expression>"
        true:
        - <action_1> ; <arguments>
        - <action_2> ; <arguments>
        false:
        - <action_3> ; <arguments>
```

## Tags for Fetching Information

The following tags can be used within a condition to dynamically fetch information:

### General Tags
- `[rfollower]`: Returns a random follower's username.
- `[ruser]`: Returns a random user from the chat.
- `[system:dateus]`: Returns the current date in US format (MM/DD/YYYY).
- `[system:dateuk]`: Returns the current date in UK format (DD/MM/YYYY).
- `[system:time]`: Returns the current time in HH:MM:SS format.
- `[uptime:seconds]`: Returns the total stream uptime in seconds.

### Variables
- `[counter:name]`: Returns the value of the counter file called `name`.
- `[text:name]`: Returns the value of the text file called `name`.
- `[boolean:name]`: Returns the value of the boolean file called `name`.
- `[list:name]`: Returns the value of the list file called `name`.

### Randomization
- `[rnumber:min-max]`: Returns a random number within the given range.
- `[rlist:name]`: Returns a random item from the specified list.

### String Manipulation
- `[xstring:text:amount]`: Returns the given `text` repeated `amount` times.

## Example Conditionals

### Example 1: `conditionals/test.yml`
```yaml
condition: '[rnumber:10-30] > 50'
true:
- chat ; Number is higher!
false:
- chat ; Number is lower or equal to
```

- **Condition**: `[rnumber:10-30] > 50` checks if a random number between 10 and 30 is greater than 50.
- **True Actions**: Sends the chat message: `"Number is higher!"`
- **False Actions**: Sends the chat message: `"Number is lower or equal to"`

---

### Example 2: `conditionals/healthcheck.yml`
```yaml
condition: '[counter:health] < 20 and [text:status] == "paralysed"'
true:
- chat ; Player is on low health AND paralysed!
false: []
```

- **Condition**: `[counter:health] < 20 and [text:status] == "paralysed"`
  - Checks if the `health` counter is below 20 and the `status` variable equals `"paralysed"`.
- **True Actions**: Sends the chat message: `"Player is on low health AND paralysed!"`
- **False Actions**: No actions are taken.

---

## Supported Operators in Conditions

You can use the following operators in your conditions:
- **Comparison**: `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`, `==`, `!=`
- **Logical**: `and`, `or`, `not`
- **Arithmetic**: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`

## Using Conditional Actions in Vayl

To trigger a conditional, you can now use either of the following formats:

### 1. Individual Conditional File
```yaml
conditional ; conditional_name
```
This format refers to a standalone file (e.g., `conditionals/conditional_name.yml`) for evaluating the conditional.

### 2. Conditional Within a File
```yaml
conditional ; file_name:conditional_name
```
This format allows you to reference a specific conditional within a file (e.g., `conditionals/file_name.yml`).

### Example
```yaml
actions:
- conditional ; test
```
This triggers the `test` conditional from the `conditionals/test.yml` file.
```yaml
actions:
- conditional ; healthcheck:low_health
```
This triggers the `low_health` conditional from the `conditionals/healthcheck.yml` file.

## Best Practices

- **Test Conditions**: Ensure your conditions use valid Python syntax and reference existing tags, counters, or text variables.
- **Organize Tags**: Use descriptive names for variables and counters for better clarity.
- **Simplify Logic**: Avoid overly complex conditions to make debugging easier.

With conditional actions and tags, Vayl allows for dynamic and interactive functionality in your Twitch chat, tailored to your specific needs. Combine these features with other actions for a fully automated and intelligent chatbot.
