## Example Event Configuration

Below is an example of how to define actions for a specific event in its corresponding YAML file:

### Example: **Follow Event**
```yaml
follow:
  enabled: true
  buffer: 0
  actions:
  - chat ; Thank you [user] for following!
  - playsound ; follow_alert
```

In this example:
- When a **Follow** event occurs, Vayl will:
  1. Send a chat message thanking the user by their username.
  2. Play a sound alert.

## Best Practices

- **Use Tags Efficiently**: Incorporate tags to personalize responses or trigger dynamic actions.
- **Test Configurations**: Ensure your YAML files are correctly formatted and actions are tested before going live.
- **Combine Events with Actions**: Use events to enhance viewer interaction by pairing them with creative actions, such as OBS integrations or custom commands.
